Control a Raspberry Pi Sense HAT LED Display

Work in progress. Your mileage may vary.

=== Why yet another Sense HAT library?

The state of affairs in Dec 2015 offers the following alternatives.

==== python-sense-hat

First, there's the original library supported by the Raspberry team 
(https://github.com/RPi-Distro/python-sense-hat).
Use this one for best user experience.
One feature is that it is written in Python.
This is a drawback if you want to be plain Javascript.

==== nodeimu

A Javascript wrapper for RTIMULib2 (https://github.com/rupnikj/nodeimu).
It _does_ supports gravity, air pressure, humidity and temperature, but not the matrix LED.

==== raspberry-sensor-sense-hat

From https://github.com/teuteuguy/raspberry-sensor-sense-hat.
Supports the matrix LED, but only via embedded python shell script escapes.
